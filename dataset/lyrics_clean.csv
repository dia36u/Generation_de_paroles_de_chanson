Lyric
"Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I can't help, falling in love with you
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin
If I can't help, falling in love with you?

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes somethings are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help, Falling in love with you

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling so it goes, somethings are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

For I can't help falling in love with you"
"Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long years
Stole many a man's soul and faith

And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah

I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made

I shouted out,
""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all
It was you and me

Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint

So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, oh yeah

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, um mean it, get down

Woo, who
Oh yeah, get on down
Oh yeah
Oh yeah!

Tell me baby, what's my name
Tell me honey, can ya guess my name
Tell me baby, what's my name
I tell you one time, you're to blame

Oh, who
woo, woo
Woo, who
Woo, woo
Woo, who, who
Woo, who, who
Oh, yeah

What's my name
Tell me, baby, what's my name
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name"
"Back in black, I hit the sack,
I've been too long,
I'm glad to be back
Yes I'm let loose from the noose,
That's kept me hangin' about
I been livin like a star 'cause it's gettin' me high,
Forget the hearse, 'cause I never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
abusing every one of them and running wild

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm baaack, baaack...
Well, I'm back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black!

Back in a band,I got Cadillac,
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes I'm in a band with a gang,
they gotta catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track
and I'm beatin' the flack,
Nobody's gonna get me on another trap
So look at me now, I'm just a makin' my pay,
Don't try to push your luck,
just get outta my way

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back! Yeah, I'm back!
Well, I'm baaack, baaack...
Well, I'm back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black!
Let's go!

[Chorus]
Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm baaack, baaack...
Well, I'm back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black-ow!

Aww yeah! Let's go!
Keep on goin'! Yeah yeah!

Baaack... (I'm back!)
Baaack...
Yes, back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black...

Outta sight!"
"Parte1
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
Snapshot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what'd'ja leave behind for me?!?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall.
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.

""You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still lady!""

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children in any way they could
(oof!)
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives.

Parte 2

We don't need no education
We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave us kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave us kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

""Wrong, Guess again! 2x
If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding.
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?
You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still laddie!""

Parte 3

I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all

No! Don't think I'll need anything at all
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall."
"Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know
It's been coming for some time

When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know
Shinin' down like water

I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?

Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know
Been that way for all my time

'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know
It can't stop, I wonder

I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?
Yeah!

I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?"
"The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I've always loved you and made you happy,
And nothing else could come between.
But now you've left me to love another;
You have shattered all of my dreams

You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away"
"You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep my faith will stand

And I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You've never failed and You won't start now

So I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Saviour

I will call upon Your name
Keep my eyes above the waves
My soul will rest in Your embrace
I am Yours and You are mine"
"How can you see into my eyes
like open doors
leading you down into my core
where I've become so numb?
Without a soul;
my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold,
until you find it there and lead it back home.

(Wake me up.)
Wake me up inside.
(I can't wake up.)
Wake me up inside.
(Save me. )
Call my name and save me from the dark.
(Wake me up. )
Bid my blood to run.
(I can't wake up. )
Before I come undone.
(Save me. )
Save me from the nothing I've become.

Now that I know what I'm without
you can't just leave me.
Breathe into me and make me real.
Bring me to life.

(Wake me up.)
Wake me up inside.
(I can't wake up.)
Wake me up inside.
(Save me. )
Call my name and save me from the dark.
(Wake me up. )
Bid my blood to run.
(I can't wake up. )
Before I come undone.
(Save me. )
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life.
(I've been living a lie/There's nothing inside.)
Bring me to life.

Frozen inside without your touch,
without your love, darling.
Only you are the life among the dead.

All of this time
I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark
but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a one thousand years it seems.
I've got to open my eyes to everything.
Without a thought
Without a voice
Without a soul
(Don't let me die here/There must be something more.)
Bring me to life.

(Wake me up.)
Wake me up inside.
(I can't wake up.)
Wake me up inside.
(Save me. )
Call my name and save me from the dark.
(Wake me up. )
Bid my blood to run.
(I can't wake up. )
Before I come undone.
(Save me. )
Save me from the nothing I've become.

Bring me to life.
(I've been living a lie/There's nothing inside.)
Bring me to life."
"Sheets of empty canvas,
Untouched sheets of clay...
Were laid spread out before me
As her body once did.

Oh all five horizons
Revolved around her soul
As the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed
Has taken a turn

Oh and all I taught her was everything
Oh, I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything?

All the pictures have
All been washed in black,
Tattooed everything

I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter so why do I sear?

Oh and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
How quick the sun can drop away

And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have, all been washed in black,
tattooed everything...

All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am and all that I'll be...yeah...

I know someday you'll have a beautiful life,
I know you'll be a star,
In somebody else's sky,
But why? why?
Why can't it be, oh can't it be mine?"
"Load up your guns and bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's overbored and self assured
Oh, no, I know a dirty word

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out its less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid, and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito
My libido
Yeah!
Hey... Yay!

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out its less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid, and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito
My libido
Yeah!
Hey... Yay!

And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard it's hard to find
Well, whatever, nevermind

Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here, we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid, and contagious

"I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you

Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Are you gone and onto someone new?
I need somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love
You die to heal
The hope that starts
The broken hearts
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

I've got another confession, my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new

Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?"
"This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said
I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
Got to make your own breaks

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said
I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life

Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

It's my life
It's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said
I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
(It's my life)

It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive

My heart is like an open highway

I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause It's my life"
"I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a stormwind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change"
"She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain to quietly pass me by

Oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Sweet love of mine

Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go now

Sweet child
Sweet child o' mine"
"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality

Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy

Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me
To me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, oh!
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth

Mama, oh!
(Anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
But sometimes wish
I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouette of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche
Will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning
Very, very frightening me

Galileo. Galileo
Galileo. Galileo
Galileo, Figaro
Magnifico!

I'm just a poor boy
And nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy
From a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstruosity

Easy come, easy go
Will you let me go?
Bismillah!
No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go!)
Will not let you go
(Let me go!)
Never, never let you go
(Let me go!)

Never let me go, oh!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia
Mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me, for me

So you think you can stone me
And spit in my eye
So you think you can love me
And leave me to die

Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here

Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah!

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
(Anyway the wind blows)"
"It starts with
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, they didn't even know
I wasted it all
just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a
memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so [far]
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me [in the end]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a
memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
for all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
for all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter"
"So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
I never cared for what they do
I never cared for what they know
And I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters"

"I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Well, every moment spent with you
Is a moment I treasure

Don't wanna close my eyes

Wondering if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together

"I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner at the room
You've sensed something's watching you

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Fear of the dark...
Fear of the dark...
Fear of the dark...
Fear of the dark...

Fear of the dark...
Fear of the dark...
Fear of the dark...
Fear of the dark...

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklores
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone"
"There's a lady who's sure all
that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven

And when she gets there she knows
if the stores are all close
With a word she can get what she came for

Oh
And she's buying a stairway to heaven

There's a sign on the wall
but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes
words have two meanings

In a tree by the brook
there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our
thoughts are misgiving

Oh it makes me wonder
Oh it makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get
when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving

In my thoughts I have seen
rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Oh it makes me wonder
Oh and it makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon
if we all called the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn
for those who stand long
And the forest will echo with laughter

Woe oh
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean
for the May Queen

Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change
the road you're on

And it makes me wonder

Oh

Your head is humming
and it won't go
in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know?
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our souls
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show

How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah

To be a rock and not to roll

Oh

And she's buying a stairway to heaven"
"(Old Man)

He waits on the midday's wind
the wave comes and lies down wearily
with a fan every day
the old one makes the water smooth

I throw the stone for fun
the water moves in circles
the old one looks sadly at me
and swept it smooth again

In the white sand, the old man
trembling, smokes his pipe
only the water and I know
why he needs this fan

The idea sleeps like a volcano
hesitating, I asked him then
his head bent, it seemed he slept
he said before he died

The water shall be your mirror
if it is smooth you will see
how many fairy tales remain for you
and you will plead for your redemption

The fan pressed against his body
the hand stiffens with rigor mortis
they had to break his fingers
the fan remains back in the sand

I call the old one every day
he would like to redeem me
I remain back in the midday's wind
and I can read in the fan

The water shall be your mirror
if it is smooth you will see
how many fairy tales remain for you
and you will plead for your redemption
"
"First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail,
I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That looked at me took to me,
shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down,
you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, they came from
Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the clouds
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived,
ebbing and flowing inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and it rained down
It rained down, like

Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down,
you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, they came from
Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future,
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived,
ebbing and flowing inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and it rained down
It rained down, like


Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down,
you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, they came from
Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer"
"Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear
that you can't shift the type
That sticks around
like something in your teeth

Are there some aces up your sleeve
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly
every night this week

How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I've found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made
for saying things
That you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling
when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy being yours to fall
for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your
heart's still open
And if so I wanna know
what time it shuts

Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly
on the cusp of trying
To kiss you
I don't know if you
Feel the same as I do
But we could be together
If you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made
for saying things
That you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling
when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy being yours to fall
for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made
for saying things
That you can't say tomorrow day

(Do I wanna know?)
Too busy being yours to fall
(Sad to see you go)
Ever thought of calling, darling?
(Do I wanna know?)
Do you want me
crawling back to you?"
"Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now

Backbeat the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I'd
Like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I'd like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe (I said maybe)

You're gonna be the one that saves me (that saves me)3x"
"Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh, no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh, no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool (fool!)
Oh, no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me
To my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh, no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard to laughing
I thought that I heard to sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try... Cry... Why?... Try...
That was just a dream, just a dream
Just a dream, dream"
"When you were here before,
Couldn't look you in the eye.
You're just like an angel,
Your skin makes me cry.
You float like a feather,
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special,
You're so fucking special.

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

I don't care if it hurts,
I wanna have control.
I want a perfect body,
I want a perfect soul.
I want you to notice,
When I'm not around.
You're so fucking special,
I wish I was special.

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

She's running out again,
She's running,
She run, run, run, run, run.

Whatever makes you happy,
Whatever you want.
You're so fucking special,
I wish I was special,

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here,
I don't belong here."
"Oh ain't she sweet,
Well see her walking down that street
Yes I ask you very confidentially:
Ain't she sweet?

Oh ain't she nice,
Well look her over once or twice
Yes I ask you very confidentially:
Ain't she nice?

Just cast an eye in her direction
Oh me oh my, ain't that perfection?

Oh I repeat
Well don't you think that's kind of neat?
Yes I ask you very confidentially:
Ain't she sweet?

Oh ain't that nice,
Well look it over once or twice
Yes I ask you very confidentially:
Ain't she nice?"
"Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take

I'll be watching you

Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay

I'll be watching you

Oh can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake

I'll be watching you

Since you've gone
I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night
I can only see your face
I look around
but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold
and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby
baby, please

Oh can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake

I'll be watching you

Every move you make
Every step you take

I'll be watching you"
"Spent 24 hours, I need more hours with you

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through

Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars
No, it's really rude if I let you meet my mama
You don't want a girl like me I'm too crazy
For every other girl you meet its fugazy
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call? Cardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden?
I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit
The red light, red light stop, stop (skrrt)

"Are we having fun yet?
Tell me, are we done yet?
Tired of being cautious, cuttin' all my losses
You make me nauseous, yeah
Am I a regret yet?
I thought you were my best bet
Was it worth what it costed?
I am exhausted
You make me nauseous, yeah

You're overrated
Nothing else left to say
You got me feeling jaded
(Ah, ah, ah)

Na-na-na, not another breakup
When I think of you, I just wanna throw up
Na-na-na, no, I don't wanna get up
Lying in my bed, thinking love sucks
Na-na-na, not another breakup
When I think of you, gotta try to be tough
Na-na-na, now I'm all fucked up
Call it bad luck, why does love suck?

Do you think I'm stupid?
I keep killing Cupid
Shot an arrow in my exes, this is my confession
Never learned my lesson, no
Your mouth is full of gossip
All my friends say that you're toxic (Ew)
Your love is like a weapon, what is the obsession?
Time to learn my lesson (Woah)

You're overrated
Nothing else left to say
You got me feeling jaded

"It must have been love but it's over now...

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched 'till the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I've turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched ‘til the time had run out

It must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows"
"When I was younger
I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart
And I watched
As he tried to reassemble it

And my momma swore that
She would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love
If it does not exist

But darling,
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know, somewhere
Deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone
Or keep a straight face

And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable, distance
And up until now
I had sworn to myself that I'm content
With loneliness

Because none of it was ever worth the risk, but
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving
In the morning, when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it`s not a dream

Ohh...

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, And I'm on my way to believing"
"See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait... without you

With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you ohoo
I can't live
With or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
and you give
And you give yourself away

My hands are tied
My body bruised, she's got me with
Nothing to win
and nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
and you give
And you give yourself away

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you"
"Soothe the young man's sweating forehead
Touch the naked stem held hidden there
Safe in such dark hayseed wired nest
Then his light brown eyes are quick
Once touch is what he thought was grip
This not his hands those there but mine
And safe, my hands to seek to gain
All knowledge of my master's manly rain
The scented taste that stills my tongue
Is wrong that is set but not undone
His fiery eyes
can slash my savage skin
And force all seriousness away

He wades in close waters
Deep sleep alters his senses
I must obey my only rival
He will command our twin revival

The same
Insane
Sustain
Again
(The two of us so close to our own hearts)
I silence and wrote
This is awe
Of the coincidence"
"I love my mini ramp
Stay away from my mini ramp
Stay way from my mini ramp

I love you baby
I love you so much
I think one day I'm gonna touch you
I'm not a part of the world
That you're living it
You're just a part of
What you gave to yourself
What's the matter with me
What's the matter with me
Don't you like, I can see your noni
Don't you like the way?
Why am I stay away?
Let's shake all the parts
That you have in your home"
"Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaking?

But, you see it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head
They are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head in your head
they are crying
In your head
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
What's in your head? In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie

Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme since 1916
In your head,
In your head
They're still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head
they are dying

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
What's in your head? In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie"
"Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a

This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a
heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down,
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream ""are we having fun yet?""

Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
Cause living with me must
have damn near killed you

And this is how, you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how, you remind me

"I've been dreamin' about the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Found some faces that I don't know (I've been dreamin' about it)
Give me the sun for just a year
I'll kiss the sky and disappear

I've been starin' up at the greyest skies
Tryna find myself some luck but it's runnin' dry
It's like the weather makes the worst of my cloudy mind
I could really use a dose of some paradise
Sometimes you gotta run from a broken heart
Before I turn into a ghost, need a brand new start
Get myself headed to the coast, man, it ain't that far
Yeah, they got sun in La and some shinin' stars

I've been dreamin' about the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Found some faces that I don't know (I've been dreamin' about it)
Seeing signs for California
Trade the shade for somethin' warmer
I've been dreamin' about the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Where the people take it real slow (I've been dreamin' about it)
I need the sun for just a year
I'll kiss the sky and disappear

Ain't felt a drop now for forty days
But still they're washing cars and they don't show any age
Ain't nothin' that you want'll cost you more than time
If you're tryna find yourself, better get in line
I'm countin' up my money and spendin' to get it right
Got the future in my pocket, I'm spendin' it all tonight
Like a prophet with the vision, I finally see the light
And you know

I've been dreamin' about the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Found some faces that I don't know (I've been dreamin' about it)
Seeing signs for California
Trade the shade for somethin' warmer
I've been dreamin' about the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Where the people take it real slow (I've been dreamin' about it)
I need the sun for just a year
I'll kiss the sky and disappear

The West Coast
Glitter nights under starry skies
All I wanna do is fly
Take me where the sun shines
I'll be there

I've been dreamin' about the West Coast
Time to find myself a new glow
I need the sun for just a year
I'll kiss the sky and disappear

I've been dreamin' about the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Found some faces that I don't know (I've been dreamin' about it)
Seein' signs for California
Trade the shade for somethin' warmer
I've been dreamin' about the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Where the people take it real slow (I've been dreamin' about it)
I need the sun for just a year
I'll kiss the sky and disappear"
"Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe
In yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me

Oh, yesterday
Came suddenly

Why she
Had to go I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said
Something wrong now I long
For yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe
In yesterday

Why she
Had to go I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said
Something wrong now I long
For yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe
In yesterday"
"Melle Mel and Richard Hell were dancing at the Taco Bell
When someone heard a rebel yell
I think it was an infidel
Adam Ant and Robert Plant were center of a sycophant
Used to buy Ulysses Grant to record at the Record Plant
Islamabad is on the nod, Havana at the riot squad
And if you want to be a Mod
You'll have to meet me at the quad

You got the best of my loco
I'll take the rest of your showboat
You got the best of my Yoko
I'll take the rest of your low notе

Parliament's Atomic Dog that hats were filling up a fog
Wе talk about the life and death of everything in analog
The seventies were such a win, singing the Led Zeppelin
Lizzy lookin' mighty thin, the Thompsons had another twin
I thought I won the lottery, the numbers never thought of me
Ramones had a lobotomy, so spin me like a pottery

I will be your poster child
You know the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight, ow
La-da-da-da, bum-bum-budum

A funky piece, the Sandinista, me and minor Mona Lisa
Judas Priest has whipped the beast
The mother love was named Teresa
Bubble gum, I come bazooka, dirty dandy nana-looka
Smoke banana in your hookah
Now I know the band is ruca
Bernie Mac and Caddyshack were dusty as the bric-a-brac
And if you ask me for the time
I'll tell you that the future's back

You got the best of my loco
I'll take the rest of your showboat
You got the best of my Yoko
I'll take the rest of your low note

Steve Miller and Duran Duran, the Joker dancing in the sand
Van Morrison, the Astral man, the festival of hurricanes
Speak of Chico and the Man, the silence of a certain lamb
Mc5 kick out the jam, a poncho full of contraband
Dairy Queen was on the scene on every preteen magazine
The Motörhead and mystic queen, I must've needed Valvoline

I will be your poster child
You know the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight
La-da-da-da, bum-bum-budum

You got me on this
But then I can't get off
With no one else but you
You turn me on too
Well, then I can't get up, ooh
For no one else but you

Creem magazine, A Love Supreme, the ballad of a Billie Jean
And now we know the Status Quo
But God would never save the Queen
Dave Mushegain, Copenhagen, copper goose of Ronald Reagan
Dollar savers, Flavor Flav, the cosmic moves are power saving
And my fist a double kissed unlisted number purple mist and
Chubby Checker do the twist, and everyone's a narcissist

You got the best of my loco
I'll take the rest of your showboat
You got the best of my Yoko
I'll take the rest of your low note

The waterbed was takin' meds, a beaver with the house of red
A fatty for the natty dread, a pocket full of talking heads
M.I.A.'s making paper planes, addiction to the days of Janes
My stuff is made of purple rain, ten fingers in the lion's mane
Giant squid, Karate Kid, Sid Vicious in the Katie-did
The planet that we must forbid, the English speakers in Madrid

I will be your poster child
You know the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight
La-da-da-da, bum-bum-budum
I will be your poster child
You know the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight
La-da-da-da, bum-bum-budum"
"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too

Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

You may say, I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A Brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

You may say, I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one"
"Oh - thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothin' can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more

And Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

Oh - once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down
Now nothin' could change what you mean to me
Oh there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
Cause our love will light the way

And Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

I've been waitin' for so long
For somethin' to arrive
For love to come along
Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
Ya - I'll be standin' there by you

And Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven, heaven, oh

You're all that I want
You're all that I need"
"I can tell by your eyes
That you've probably been crying forever
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothing
To you, they're a mirror.

I don't want to talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here won't you listen to my heart?
Oh, my heart...

If I stand all alone
Will the shadows hide the colors of my heart?
Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears
The stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you
They're Just a mirror.

I don't want to talk about it,
How you broke my heart.
If I stay here just a little bit longer,
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
Oh, my heart..."
"Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination.

I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this
brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar.

And so I wake up in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?

And I say: Hey! yeah yeaaah, Hey yeah yea
I said hey, what's going on?

And I say: Hey! yeah yeaaah, Hey yeah yea
I said hey, what's going on?

ooh, ooh ooh

and I try, oh my god do I try
I try all the time, in this institution

And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution.

And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake up in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?

And I say, hey hey hey hey
I said hey, what's going on?

Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
for a destination."
"(Words & music by Hirschhorn - Kascho)
Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a lot of dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
But when it does your heart will know

You're gonna be a beautiful woman
Because you're such a beautiful child
And when you start to bloom
Just like a rose in June
I bet the schoolboys all go wild, but right now

Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a few dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
When it does your heart will know

Your life's still a lollipop heaven
Your teddy bear's at the foot of your bed
The little boy next door who only makes you sore
Is gonna some day turn your head but right now

Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a few dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
When it does your heart will know

You're gonna grow over night into a lady
With a devastatingly smile ???
And then a lucky guy will see you
And wanna walk you down the aisle, but meanwhile

Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a few dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
When it does your heart will know
When it does your heart will know
"
"(Jagger/Richards)


I went up to the island,
to see that Angel was home
I went, out to the station,
to see that the train was a blue
I was looking for my baby, well,
see that my Angel was home

I called up your father , to see that the train where does it go
And he offered me your sister,
but she's hooked here for later was so
And I'm lookin' for my baby, but it, looks like
my Angel Looks like my baby...
yeah she's gone

Well, I went out to the main town
to see the train was lost
And I, went to your wedding,
and I saw the veil that you wore

Well I'm looking for my baby,
it looks my Angel Looks like my Angel... is gone"
"Give me a big beat
Now here this, now here this
Each generation rules the nation
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
She was a fast machine
She kept the motor clean
She was the bast damn woman that I'd ever seen
She had the sightless eyes
Tellin me no lies
Knocking me out with those american thighs
Takin more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come but I was already there
Coz the walls start shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it you
(chorus)
You shook me all ight long
Yeah you
Shook me all night long


Working double time
On the seduction line
She was one of a kind, shes just mine all mine
She wanted no applause
Just another course
She made a meal out of me and came back for more
Had to cool down
To take another round
Now im back in the ring to take another swing
Cause the walls was shaking
The earth was quakin
My mind was achin
And we were making it you
(chorus)
Shook me all night long
Yeah you
Shook me all night long
An knocked me out and then you
Shook me all night long
Had me shakin and then you
Shook me all night loong
Well you took me
Well you took me


Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on


Heres the spiecial news bullitan
Stand by
Heres the apiecial news bullitan
Stand by for action
Shot to the heart and your to blame
Shot to the heart
Shot to the heart
Shot to the heart and your to blame
Darlin you give love a bad name


When your high you never ever want to get down
So down
So down
So down huh!"
"They flutter behind you your possible pasts,
Some brighteyed and crazy,
some frightened and lost.
A warning to anyone still in command
Of their possible future, to take care.
In derelict sidings the poppies entwine
With cattle trucks lying in wait
For the next time.

Do you remember me?
How we used to be?
Do you think we shoud be closer?

She stood in the doorway,
the ghost of a smile
Haunting her face
Like a cheap hotel sign.
Her cold eyes imploring
The men in their macs
For the gold in their bags
Or the knives in their backs.
Stepping up boldly
One put out his hand.
He said: ""I was just a child then,
Now I'm only a man.""

Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?

By the cold and religious
We were taken in hand.
Shown how to feel good
And told to feel bad.
And strung out behind us
The banners and flags of our possible pasts
Lie in tatters and rags.

Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?"
"I have some good time, I have some bad time.
But it seem I get movin' my shift of the worst time.
There ain't no place in this whole wide world, for one lonely boy.
It seem I ain't never, never gonna find no calls for jobs.

Some people get rich, I would only get poor.
Some people love to have a good time
and won't let me in the door.
I've been halfway around this world and nothing did I have.
But now it seem my turn has come, a time for me to grab.

You got to get it before it gets you.
Oh you got to get it before it gets you.
Lord, you got to get it before it gets you and everything will be
Alright.
Some people try and never have found,
I turned the whole world upside down.
Gonna get it before it gets you.
Oh I say you got to get it before it gets you.
Oh try to get it before it gets you."
"I have sailed the peaceful waters
Of the ocean deep and blue
I held my breath and watched
The western sunset's golden hue

I've flown above the mountain peaks
And valley's wide and green
But you're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

You're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
I have searched for happiness so long and far
But my search for love was through
The day that I found you
'Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are

I confess that I've been tempted
By a luring magic charm
When a smile was flashed my way
And stood before two open arms
But I turned and walked away because
I love you like I do
You're the nearest thing to heaven, darling you

You're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
I have searched for happiness so long and far
But my search for love was through
The day that I found you
'Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are

I have watched the silver raindrops
Fall to earth to cool the day
Watched the rainbow at twilight
When the clouds had blown away
I loved the pretty flowers
But he cannot buy their worth
But you're the nearest thing to heaven on this earth

You're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
I have searched for happiness for long and far
But my search for love was through
The day that I found you
'Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are"
"Yours is the kingdom and the power,
and the glory forever is yours.
Heaven and earth bow down in the wonder of Your Name.
Heaven is open, death is broken,
and the glory forever is yours.
Nothing can overcome, the Power of Your Name,
King above Kings, all the universe will sing.
Everlasting God, You are wonderful,
You are wonderful and the shout of the earth will be Your praise,
God forever and the light unto all, will be Your wonderful Name.
For the glory Lord is yours,
God forever all the glory is yours."
"My reflection, dirty mirror
There's no connection to myself
I'm your lover, I'm your zero
I'm the face in your dreams of glass

So save your prayers
For when you're really gonna need 'em
Throw out your cares and fly
Wanna go for a ride?

She's the one for me
She's all I really need
'Cause she's the one for me

Emptiness is loneliness and loneliness is cleanliness
And cleanliness is godliness, and God is empty just like me

Intoxicated with the madness
I'm in love with my sadness
Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms
The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth

I never let on that I was on a sinking ship
I never let on that I was down
You blame yourself, for what you can't ignore
You blame yourself for wanting more

She's the one for me
She's all I really need
She's the one for me
She's my one and only"
"This broken wheel is coming undone
and the road's exploding
but you're keeping me strong
rolling along with you
love is a tower, and you're the key
leading me higher, when you let me in
keeping us close (so close)
oh, on down the line
sometimes I burn like a dot on the sun
with no one knowing
but you're keeping me strong
moving along with you
you are a tower, of strength to me
the darkening hour, sees light again
again...
ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah
you are, you are, you are, you are
you are...
love is a tower, of strength to me
I am the shoreline, but you're the sea
the sea
you are, you are...
..."
"I will never walk it through
I could never promise you
It's some planes follow dew
I will never wanna drew
This will mean I'll love again
Guess I'll never have a fan
This will mean me to me
I could never have a seam
It's a neverending dream
I will always want to faint
If I'm me you'll never know
Everything I ever know
Free

It's another point of view
Look at me when I was you
I could never die again
I won't lose another friend
She will see another me
When I'm through I'll meditate
Guess I'll know I'll medicate
Guess I'll fall and medicate
This'll never open hate
For me is here to say

Me
Ring
Hmmmm

I will never promise you
Ring"

"When you're feeling lost and blue
When there is no love for you
You'll find him and it's all right
It's all right, it's all right

When you're feeling down and low
When you've got no place to go
And when no one smiles hello
He's by your side, you know

When you're getting deaf and blind
When you drag one leg behind
And when you're finally gonna
Lose your mind
It's all right, it's all right
It's all right

'Cause he will be your guide
'Cause he will be your light

Look into my eyes and you'll see I'm the only one
You've captured my love stolen my heart
Changed my life
Every time you make a move you destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside
You take my breath away

You can reduce me to tears with a single sigh
(Please don't cry anymore)
Every breath that you take
Any sound that you make is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life for just one kiss
I would surely die if you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away

So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you anywhere you go
I'll be right behind you
Right until the ends of the earth
I'll get no sleep until I find you
To tell you that you just take my breath away

I will find you anywhere you go
Right until the ends of the earth

To tell you when I've found you
I love you

Take my breath take my breath... away"

"Young lust
Happy just to be in lust
Never have to eat no dust
Everybody talk about

Young lust
You're dyin' and you're screamin' inside
Oh, you're guilty way before you been tried
It's crazy but you're diggin' it

Young lust
You feel it in the summertime blues
Oh, easy when there's nothin' to lose
And baby you been missin' out

Young lust
Sometimes you need it so bad
It's enough to drive a young girl mad
So what you gonna do about it

A little bit o' nasty
You look a little sleazy
But don't get any on you

Young lust
You better keep your daughter inside
Or she's gonna get a dose of my pride
Yeah, everybody talks about it

Young lust
Once you had it you can never go back
Don't you ever let 'em give you no slack
When you're streakin' down the alley way

Checkin' out the ladies
Who didn't bring their boyfriends
Who love to get in trouble
I got to say I'll see you later,
meet me in the elevator

Always gettin' stronger
Never gettin' weaker
My love is gettin' longer
I'll keep it in my sneaker
Never keep a secret
Never feelin' guilty
Never gettin' lonely
Never gettin' no peace, hidin' from the police

Sneakin' out the back way
Sneakin' down the alley way
Gotta do it my way
Do it in the sunshine
Hangin' from the clothesline
Find another tree to climb

There's no time for lovin'
Young lust
No, don't need one in the oven
Young lust
I'm a-pushin' and a-shovin' it

Young lust
Come on now I just can't wait
Are you fishin' or you gonna cut bait
Everybody body doin' it

Young lust
Honey now ain't it a bitch
Sometime you gotta scratch that itch
So what you gonna do about it"
"I was born into a scene
Of angriness and greed
Of dominance and persecution

My mother was a queen
My dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be.

Now I spend my time
Looking all around
For a man that's nowhere
To be found,
Until I find him,
I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm going to find my man
Gonna travel round.

Chorus
Cos I'm a wrathchild,
Well I'm a wrathchild,
Yeh I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you...ooh yeah yeah

Some say it shouldn't matter
Ain't nothing gonna alter
The course of my destination

But I know I've gotta find
Some serious peace of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy

Now I spend my time
Looking all around
For a man that's nowhere
To be found,
Until I find him,
I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm going to find my man
Gonna travel round."
"Lyin', cheatin', hurtin, that's all you seem to do.
Messin' around with every guy in town,
Puttin' me down for thinkin' of someone new.

Always the same, playin' your game,
Drive me insane, trouble is gonna come to you,
One of these days and it won't be long,
You'll look for me but baby, I'll be gone.
This is all I gotta say to you woman:

*Your Time Is Gonna Come X4

Made up my mind to break you this time,
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry.
Do what you want, I won't take the brunt.
It's fadin' away, can't feel you anymore.

Don't care what you say 'cause I'm goin' away to stay,
Gonna make you pay for that great big hole in my heart.
People talkin' all around,

Watch out woman, no longer
Is the joke gonna be on my heart.
You been bad to me woman,
But it's coming back home to you.

* Chorus"
"(Translation To: Du Riechst So Gut)

Insanity
is only a narrow bridge
the banks are reason and desire
I chase you
the sunlight confuses the mind
a blind child that crawls forward
because it smells its mother

I find you

The track is fresh and on the bridge
drops the sweat, your warm blood
I don't see you
I only smell you, I sense you
a predator that screams of hunger
I track you for miles by scent

You smell so good
you smell so good
I follow you
you smell so good
I find you
- so good
I chase you
you smell so good
I will have you soon

Now I have you

I wait until it is dark
then I take hold of your wet skin
don't betray me
oh don't you see the bridge is burning
stop screaming and don't resist
because otherwise it will break apart

You smell so good
you smell so good
I follow you
you smell so good
I find you
- so good
I chase you
you smell so good
I will have you soon

You smell so good
you smell so good
I follow you
you smell so good
I find you
- so good
I touch you
you smell so good
now I have you

You smell so good
you smell so good
I follow you

"I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high
Send me never demigod

I remember walking in the cold of november
Hoping that I make it to the end of december
27 Years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't want to hear about what to do
I don't want to do it just to do it for you

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty
And there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough
For anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

I find it hard to tell you how I want to run away
I understand it always makes you feel
A certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down
Send me never demigod

I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 Years and I've nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for a path of the young and lonely
I don't want to hear about what to do, no
I don't want to do it just to do it for you

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty
And there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out!

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough
For anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out!

Let me tell you bout it
Let me tell you bout it
Maybe you're the same as me

Let me tell you bout it
Let me tell you bout it
They say the truth will set you free

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty
And there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out!

"You got your H. P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allan Poe
You got your unkind of ravens
And your murder of crows

Catty eyelashes and your Dracula cape
Been flashing triple A passes
At the cemetery gates

'Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, babe

You're so dark
You're so dark
You're so dark

And you're so mysterious
Got that obsession with death
I saw you driving your Prius
And even that was Munster Koach-esque

You watch Italian horror and you listen to The Scores
Leather-clad and spike collar
I want you down on all fours

'Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby

I know you're nothing like mine
'Cause she's walking on Sunshine
And your love would tear us apart
And I know I'm not your type
'Cause I don't shun the daylight
But baby, I'm willing to start

(Ooh)

You're so dark

Got your H. P. Lovecraft
(Lovecraft)
Your Edgar Allan Poe
(Poe)
Got your unkind of ravens
(Ravens)
Got your murder of crows

You're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby
But I want you hard
You're so dark, oh
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby"
"Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and everyday
I can hear them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try?
I can never win
Seeing them hearing them
In the state I'm in

How could she say to me
""Love will find a way""?
Gather 'round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away"
"You wanted a challenge
That's calling you higher
I landed on my feet by crawling
I remember standing alone trying to forget you idling
I hate to admit that that's my reference point
but there it is you say you want me

I'm what you found I'm upside down you're in the air
You're in the air and I am breathing

Brighten the stars
The weather is lifting
The heavens love a love like this
It's pulling you higher twist it and turn this around
It lights from within it dribbles your chin now
brings a smile I'm lost again
I'm lost again

I'm what you found I'm upside down you're in the air
You're in the air and I am breathing you

I want the stars to know they've won if only to beguile
The sky has opened up again in
Heaven reconciled
I want you naked I want you wild
I want the stars to know they win
Give me that smile just give it me just turn it on
I'm lost again

I'm what you found I'm upside down you're in the air
I'm what you found I'm upside down you're in the air
I'm what you found I'm upside down you're everywhere
You're in the air and I am breathing you"
"I must get out once in a while
Everything is starting to die
The dust settles, the worms dig
Spiders crawl over the bed

I must get out once in a while
I eat all day and now I'm fat
Yesterday's meal is hugging the plate
"
"When I stare the ground of
My land
Burning loose as dancing flames
I asked the man there
Up in he heavens
If I deserve me this kind of pain
I asked the man there
Up in he heavens
If I deserve me this kind of pain

Everywhere the ground is so dry
No trees, no green, just grey
Lost my cattle, my appaloosa
For lack of water some took away
I lost my cattle, my appaloosa
For lack of water some took away

Even white winged birds flew away
Flew away from my land sight
It was when I said goodbye
Sweet rosie
Keep in to your heart, this heart of mine
It was when I said goodbye
Sweet rosie
Keep in to your heart, this heart of mine

Many thousands miles away, now
Feeling lonely, lost and blue
I keep on waiting rain falls again there
So I'll be back thou home again
I keep on waiting rain falls again there
So I can go back thou home again

When the glow green of your eyes
Flows again all over land
I can assure you, so don't
You cry, no
'cause I'll be back, see
To you again!!
I can assure you, so don't
You cry, no
'cause I'll be back, see
To you again!!"
"Turn on my vcr
Same one I've had for years
James brown on the tammy show
Same tape I've had for years
I sit in my old car
Same one I've had for years
Old battery's running down
It ran for years and years

Turn on the radio
The static hurts my ears
Tell me where would I go
I ain't been out in years
Turn on the stereo
It's played for years and years
An otis redding song
It's all I own

When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around

Plug in my mci
To excercise my brain
Make records on my own
Can't go out in the rain
Pick up the telephone
I've listened here for years
No-one to talk to me
I've listened here for years

When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around

When I feel lonely here
Don't waste my time with tears
I run deep throat again
It ran for years and years
Don't like the food I eat
The cans are running out
Same food for years and years
I hate the food I eat

When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around

When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around"
"I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen
She left before I had the chance to say
The words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late, she's gone away

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking: ""Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?""
Hard to believe that

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
The noises that she made kept me awake
The weight of things that remained unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us everyday

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking: ""Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?""
Hard to believe that

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

Of all the things I felt but never really shown
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go, oh oh oh

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you"
"New things are going on every day
The people always come but never stay
I'm counting on you to make it right
I wanna be with you tonight

And you can save me from the darkness
And you can scare away the monsters in my head
And you can make me feel like I have somebody
And the pain will go away

'Cause I'm a young pretender
Drowning in my guilt and sorrow
I try to be like the others sometimes
By pretending to be somebody I'm not
I'm a young pretender
Wanderin' the distance
You make my life complete
I want to see you again

Everybody thinks I'm one way
As far as they can tell
But some people start to see
That I'm just not who they want me to be

But then you came along
To show me right from wrong
My life improved so greatly
My heart bursting out in song...

'Cause I'm a young pretender
Drowning in my guilt and sorrow
I try to be like the others sometimes
By pretending to be somebody I'm not
I'm a young pretender
Wanderin' the distance
You make my life complete
I want to see you again

'Cause I'm a young pretender
Drowning in my guilt and sorrow
I try to be like the others sometimes
By pretending to be somebody I'm not
I'm a young pretender
Wanderin' the distance
You make my life complete
I want to see you again

Can't you see I can't pretend no more?
What am I even pretending for?
I just can't be the girl you want me to be
But if you look inside me you will see...

A lone girl, a confused girl, yep that's me
And if you get to know this real girl you will see
The fun-loving teen she used to be
But which way to her heart unlocks the key?"
"I wake up in a different daylight, guess I haven't been around. See me follow the shadow haunting your body, naked like water - shining like honey / Move me - You turn me on - The thrill of it all. You turn me on - The thrill of it all. You turn me on - The thrill of it all / I read in the paper how everything's changed, but it's all the same - it's out of the game. I reach out and touch an endless temptation, live in a dream - the strangest sensation / Move me - You turn me on ... / The lines I have written are the lines on your face, they merge out of nowhere - and leave with no trace. And I've had the feeling we're turnin' to one, when everything's said - when everything's done / Move me - You turn me on ... / You move me - Oh, baby, turn me on.

"You've come to tell me something you say I ought to know
That he don't love me anymore and I'll have to let him go
You say you're gonna take him oh but I don't think you can

Because you ain't woman enough to take my man

Women like you they're a dime a dozen you can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body so get out while you can
Because you ain't woman enough to take my man

Sometimes a man start lookin' at things that he don't need
He took a second look at you but he's in love with me
Well I don't know where they leave you oh but I know where I'll stand
And you ain't woman enough to take my man

Women like you they're a dime a dozen you can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body so get out while you can
Because you ain't woman enough to take my man"

Zooropa, be all that you can be.
Be a winner, eat to get slimmer.

Zooropa, a bluer kind of white
Zooropa, it could be yours tonight.
We're mild and green and squeaky clean.

Zooropa, better by design
Zooropa, fly the friendly skies.
Through the appliance of science
We've got that ring of confidence.
And I have no compass
And I have no map
And I have no reasons
No reasons to get back.

And I have no religion
And I don't know what's what
And I don't know the limit
The limit of what we got.

Zooropa, to get you through the night.
Zooropa, it's cold outside, but brightly lit
Zooropa, let's skip the subway,
Zooropa, let's go to the overground.
Get your head out of the mud baby
Put flowers in the mud baby,
Overground.

No particular place names
No particular song
I've been hiding
What am I hiding from?

Zooropa, don't worry, baby, it's gonna be alright
Zooropa, uncertainty can be a guiding light.
Zooropa, I hear voices, ridiculous voices
Zooropa, in the slipstream.
Zooropa, let's go, let's go overground.
Zooropa, take your head out of the mud, baby.

She's gonna dream out loud, she's gonna dream out loud,
She's gonna dream out loud, dream out loud."
"The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68
And he told me all romantics
meet the same fate someday
Cynical and bitter and boring someone in some dark cafe
You laugh, he says you think you're immune
go look at your eyes
They're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies, pretty lies
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies
Only pretty lies, pretty lies

He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer, and he pushed
Three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a waitress came by
in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said ""Drink up now it's gettin' on time to close. ""
""Richard, you haven't really changed, "" I said
It's just that now you're romanticizing
some pain that's in your head
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs
You punched are dreaming
Listen, they talk of love so sweet, love so sweet
When you gonna get back on your feet?
Love can be so sweet, love so sweet

Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dishwasher and a Coffee percolator
And he drinks at home now most nights
with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out
I don't want nobody comin' over to my table
I got nothing to talk to anybody about
All good dreamers pass this way some day
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafes
Dark cafes
Only this darkness
Before I get my gorgeous wings
And I fly away
Only a phase, these dark cafe days"
"So far away, but it's ok
It's all right
I'm gonna live my life
You're not with me today
But i try to understand
It's all right
I'm gonna live my life

I don't wanna let you go

So far away, so i'm missing you
That's always you
You're so far away

Behind the wall so many dreams fall down
It's all right
I'm gonna live my life

You said to me you're out
You've just cried enough
It's all right
I'm gonna live my life

I don't wanna let you go

So far away, so i'm missing you
That's always you
You're so far away"
"I heard she loved you, I heard she cared,
I heard she miscarried and you were scared.

Did you run from the one,
Who conceived your child?
Yesterday's gone there's no return,
And she cries all night.

Did you run from the one
Who conceived your child?
Yesterday's done there's no return,
And she cries all night.
Solo.

I believe that a woman can be a slave to a man.
I believe that love that you gave and we try it again.

Will you return to the one,
Who conceived your child?
Yesterday's gone there's no return,
And she cries all night.

Will you return to the one,
Who conceived your child?
Yesterday's done there's no return,
And she cries all night.

Did you run from the one,
Who conceived your child?
Yesterday's gone there's no return,
And she cries all night."

Uh ohh
Now I stared at you
From across the room
Until both my eyes were faded it
I was in a rush
I was out of luck
Now I'm so glad that I waited
Well you were almost there
Almost mine...yeah
They say love ain't fair
But I'm doing fine...

Cause I swear it's you
I swear it's you

I swear it's you that my heart beats for
And it ain't gonna stop
No it just won't stop
Uh oh oh
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Now you were fine by night
But when the morning light comes
Comfortable as rain on Sunday
And I'm a lucky soul
That holds your hand so tight
Hope you hear this one day
Don't fool yourself
This is my truth

I swear it's you
I swear it's you
I swear it's you that I've waited for

You take this hand
You take this heart
Steal my bones
From 1000 miles apart
Feels so cold
Felt just like it's ten shades of winter
And I need the sun
Ohh yeahh
Oh oh no no yeah yeah

And I swear it's you

Now teach me everything
That i should know

Can i open your core
So gentle and wide
Like your eyes girl

Rack 'em up stretch 'em out
When they're tight
This acetylene torch is giving me sight

Freeze on the radio
I've got to leave and more

Do the caribou bite
When they look into you

Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?

Oh i need a dirty woman
Oh i need a dirty girl

Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock and roll refugee
Oh babe, set me free

Oh i need a dirty woman
Oh i need a dirty girl
Oh i need a dirty woman
Oh i need a dirty girl"
"It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we could both live

If I was a sculptor but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody that this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses
well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody that this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world"
"Here i am and i'm waitin' on a chance to make it right
Every word you say makes my heart go bang bang
'Cause it sounds so nice
Well i've been alone
And you've been a fool
Baby don't you know that's the golden rule
Well i've been alone
And you've been a fool
Baby don't you know that's the way i like it
Let me take you away on the wings of my superfly
Maybe we'll celebrate all the room in the sky
Heaven knows we'll go boom boom boom
What can i do to get you in the mood
Baby i give up
I'm so misused and you're so confused
It's such a drag
Well i've been alone
And you've been a fool
Baby don't you know that's the golden rule
Well i've been alone and you've been a fool
Baby don't you know that's the way i like it
Let me take you away on the wings of my superfly
Maybe we'll celebrate all the room in the sky
Heaven knows we'll go boom boom boom
Here i am and i'm waitin' on a chance
To make it right
Do i turn you on or maybe i turn you off
Could you just decide
Well i've been alone
And you've been a fool
Baby don't you know that's the golden rule
Well i've been alone
And you've been a fool
Baby don't you know that's the way i like it
Let me take you away on the wings of my superfly
Maybe we'll celebrate all the room in the sky
Let me take you away on the wings of my superfly
Maybe we'll celebrate all the room in the skyheaven knows we'll go boom boom boom
